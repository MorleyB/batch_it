<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>JIA is located about 25km east of central Johannesburg in Kempton Park. Between 5am and 10pm, buses run every half hour between JIA and Park Station (US$11, 45 minutes). The area immediately around Park Station is confusing and known for muggings. The Airport Link (884 3957) is a reputable airport shuttle. Taxis are expensive at around US$43 one way to the northern suburbs. Most hostels will collect you from the airport.Metropolitan Bus Services (Metrobus; 375 5555; www.mbus.co.za; Gandhi Sq) runs services covering 108 routes in the Greater Jo’burg area. Fares work on a zone system, ranging from zone one (US$0.50) to zone eight (US$1.40).If you do take a minibus taxi into central Jo’burg, be sure to get off before it reaches the end of the route and avoid the taxi rank – it’s a mugging zone. US$0.70 will get you around the inner suburbs and the city centre, and US$1.20 will get you almost anywhere.Taxis operate meters if they work. It’s wise to ask a local the likely price and agree on a fare at the outset. From the taxi rank at Park Station to Rosebank should cost around US$10. There has been a very serious problem with violent crime on the metro system, mostly on those lines connecting with black townships. The Jo’burg–Pretoria metro line should also be avoided.</p>
<p>Travel Alert: Crime is a serious problem in Johannesburg; see the Dangers &amp; Annoyances section for details.Jo’burg, or ‘Jozi’ as it’s more commonly known, is without a doubt the great big beating heart of South Africa, and has long played a Jekyll-and-Hyde role in the global consciousness. Often the stage on which the epic of this extraordinary nation has been played out, the colossus of Jo’burg – with all its thrills and foibles – is today a fascinating, multitudinous city, where all the ups and downs of 21st-century South Africa can be witnessed in three, multicolour dimensions.In the past, the city’s darker personality proved the most enduring. The Jo’burg of the newsflash was a city where fear and loathing reigned supreme; a city where spiralling gun crime and poverty had manifested itself in a society where one half of the population stagnated, while the other looked on impassively through coils of razor wire.As ever, there is an element of truth to the stereotypes. Jo’burg does bear scars of South Africa’s turbulent 20th century, and many will take time to heal. Stark inequalities persist, but armed with a new self-confidence – ironically most pronounced in the infamous township of Soweto – Africa’s giant hub is beginning to introduce itself to a healthier diet of urban renewal and social regeneration. </p>
